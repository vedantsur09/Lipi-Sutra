# 📜 LipiSutra — Historical Document AI

> *"We are losing centuries of knowledge without saying a word."*

**LipiSutra** is an end-to-end multimodal AI platform that digitizes, reconstructs and preserves historical Indian manuscripts — doing what no existing tool does. Not just translating, but restoring, reconstructing and preserving while keeping the human touch alive at every step.

## 🚨 The Problem

India holds an estimated **50 million undigitized manuscripts** and historical land records written in complex regional scripts — Maratha-era Modi, Sanskrit, Brahmi — that fewer than **0.1% of the population** can read today.

These documents are:
- Physically deteriorating across fragmented, isolated archives
- Completely inaccessible to modern researchers, cross-linguistic scholars and visually impaired users
- Vulnerable to AI hallucinations being passed off as historical fact — corrupting academic datasets permanently

**There is currently no single platform capable of intelligent reconstruction, multimodal accessibility and rigorous hallucination prevention.**

## 💡 The Solution

LipiSutra serves three distinct user types through a **Role-Based Perspective Switcher** — no login required:

| Role | Access | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🌍 **Public / Student** | Full read access, free | Upload documents, receive structured output, TTS audio |
| 🏛️ **Historian** | Verified expert layer | Convert AI predictions to permanently verified data |
| 🏢 **Museum / Admin** | Bulk upload portal | Institutional digitization pipeline + analytics dashboard |

## 🚀 5 Core Innovations

### 1. 🔍 Contextual Inpainting — Intelligent Reconstruction
When a manuscript is torn or ink is faded, existing OCR tools output "unreadable." LipiSutra uses surrounding sentences and contextual relationships within the document to logically predict missing words and phrases. This is not a guess — it is a **context-driven reconstruction** treating the document as a living semantic structure.

### 2. 🎨 Confidence-Based Color Provenance System
Every AI prediction carries a confidence score enforced through strict visual accountability:

| Color | Meaning | Confidence |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 🟡 Yellow | AI prediction — flagged for historian review | Above 75% |
| 🔴 Red | AI prediction — mandatory human intervention | Below 75% |
| 🟣 Purple | Historian verified — mathematically confirmed — permanently locked | 100% |

No other historical digitization platform enforces this level of **transparent color-coded AI accountability**. Hallucinations cannot quietly pass as historical fact.

### 3. 🧠 RLHF — The System Gets Smarter Over Time
Every historian correction is logged in Firestore as structured JSON — storing the original AI prediction, corrected version, script type, document era and historian credentials. This builds LipiSutra's own **proprietary ground-truth dataset**.

- **Short term** — verified corrections act as a lookup layer, improving accuracy on similar patterns instantly
- **Long term** — this dataset becomes training data for a specialized model fine-tuned on historical Indian scripts

### 4. 🔐 Cryptographic Deduplication
Every uploaded image is instantly hashed using **SHA-256**. If the document has been previously verified, the entire AI pipeline is bypassed — serving the cached Purple-verified result in **50 milliseconds**. This reduces cloud compute costs by up to **99%** for redundant archives.

### 5. 🤝 Human Touch at Every Layer
Civilians contribute documents. Historians verify predictions. The system learns from corrections. Human participation in LipiSutra is **not optional — it is structural**. This is what makes the dataset mathematically sound and academically trustworthy over time.

## 💰 Feasibility — ₹0 Operational Cost

The entire platform is architected on free and open-source tools:

- **Google ADK** — open source
- **Gemini via Google AI Studio** — free tier
- **Firebase Spark Plan** — free tier
- **React/Vite** — open source
- **Python FastAPI** — open source

**Immediately deployable for underfunded government archives, NGOs and local museums without any financial barrier.**

### Scalability
By decoupling the frontend from heavy AI processing via an asynchronous event-driven queue, LipiSutra remains highly responsive under concurrent upload loads. The SHA-256 deduplication layer means up to **99% of requests** for redundant archives never touch the AI pipeline.

### Flexibility — Model-Agnostic
Our multi-agent orchestration is completely model-agnostic. While we currently leverage Gemini for superior multimodal capabilities, our backend pipeline is not vendor-locked. Specific OCR agents can be swapped as new academic research emerges — making LipiSutra adaptable to **any historical script globally**.
